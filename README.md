My personal adguard home blocker/unblocker list

Installation
## adblocker filters

Options
1. Use a browser which supports extensions/add-ons and install an adblocker (like uBlock Origin or AdGuard).
2. Use software like adguard home or pi-hole
Now add custom (content)filter from here: [(copy link)](https://gitea.rcs1.xyz/sickprodigy/adguard-list/raw/branch/main/assets/Filter-1.txt):

This is mainly to block out some of the missing trackers and bad actors that are still able to load into my network.
Use in congruent with any other filters. This filter actually unblocks some sites to make them usable ex t.co, you can't navigate twitter/x links without expecting a t.co transfer link. 

A lot of time for paywall sites you can just disable javascript and a lot of functions will disappear.
Other times you will need userscripts i believe. magnolia1234 has explained it well in their scripts if interested.
